# portfolio-sqlalchemy

A portfolio web application built using Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy. Through the use of the ORM, the user is able to input details about a project they have worked on in the past in order for it to be stored in a SQLite database and displayed within the app. An already existing project's information can be edited by the user, as well as there being an option to delete each project. Details of a specific project can be viewed by accessing the project from the nav-bar's drop down menu.

To run the project locally, set up a virtual environment with the requirements listed in requirements.txt. Run app.py and paste the url outputted in the terminal to your browser.
